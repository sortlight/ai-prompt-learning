# Day 1 – Intro to Prompt Engineering

##  What I Learned
Today marks the beginning of my 7-day AI prompt learning journey. I explored the basics of prompt engineering, its value and how changing the structure of prompts affects outputs.

Prompt engineering is the art of designing input to get better responses from AI models. It's not coding per say it's communication with a machine.

Key principles I learned:
- **Be specific:** Clear instructions = better responses
- **Set roles:** "Act as..." changes the output style
- **Structure your request:** Bullets, tone, length — pretty much all matters

##  Resources I Used
- [Prompt Engineering Guide (DAIR.AI)](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide)
- [OpenAI Cookbook Prompt Examples](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook)
- [Prompting 101 – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF7xYFB8x84)

###  Prompt 1 – Summarization

**Input Paragraph:**  
“Artificial Intelligence is transforming how we interact with technology. From voice assistants to self-driving cars, AI is reshaping industries and automating repetitive tasks.”

**Prompt A:** Summarize the paragraph in 1 sentence. 
"Arsenal are reportedly ready to renew their interest in prolific Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres by making a fresh offer for his services,
just when it looked like the chances of a spectacular transfer were done for the Manchester United target.  
Adding a new No.9 to Mikel Arteta’s ranks remains a huge priority for the Gunners this summer after Kai Havertz and 
Gabriel Jesus both suffered serious injuries last season that ultimately ended up derailing their Premier League title hopes. 

**Output:**  

    > Arsenal are set to make a new bid for Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres as they prioritize signing a new No.9 following 
    injuries to Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus last season.

> AI is changing technology by automating tasks and reshaping industries.

**Prompt B:** Summarize in 3 bullet points.  
"Gyokeres and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko have been the main two names linked with moves to The Emirates, while the likes of Victor Osimhen, 
Dusan Vlahovic and Alexander Isak have also been mentioned in dispatches.  Sesko was Arsenal’s top target during the 2024 summer window,
only for the Slovenia international to commit to the Bundesliga outfit for another season.
And while TEAMtalk can confirm that the 22-year-old talent very much remains on the club’s radar, 
the sheer goalscoring exploits of Gyokeres make the Swede a very hard man to ignore – despite the issues that have surfaced when it comes to trying to snatch the player from Sporting.

**Output:** 

         >  Arsenal have been primarily linked with Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko as potential striker signings.

         >   Sesko was the club’s top target for summer 2024 but chose to stay at RB Leipzig for another season.

          >  Despite complications in signing him, Gyokeres remains a strong contender due to his impressive goal-scoring record.

            
- AI transforms tech interactions  
- It powers voice assistants and self-driving cars  
- It automates repetitive tasks

 **Lesson:** Prompt format affects output granularity.

### Prompt 2 – Style Change

**Prompt A:** Explain AI in a formal tone.  
**Output:**  
> Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require cognitive functions such as learning and decision-making.

**Prompt B:** Explain it like a 10-year-old to a friend.  
**Output:**  
> AI is like a robot brain that helps computers do smart things, like talk or play games with you.

**Lesson:** You can control tone, complexity, and audience by changing prompt tone.

### Prompt 3 – Creative Prompt

**Prompt:** Write a short poem about a lonely robot who discovers love.

**Output:**  
> In wires and steel the robot lay,  
> Alone each night, alone each day.  
> Until a spark, a voice so kind,  
> Brought joy and peace into its mind.  
> Now circuits hum with glowing grace,  
> As love reflects in metal face.

 **Lesson:** AI creativity can be shaped by tone, theme and emotion in your prompt.

## Reflection
I used to think AI just “knew” what I wanted. Now I see that **the way I ask is everything**.

Tomorrow, I’ll explore **role prompting** — getting the AI to "act" in specific ways.
